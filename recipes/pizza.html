    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pizza base (6 inch)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Pizza/Pasta Sauce</li>
        <li>1 onion, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>Sweet corn kernels, par-boiled as required</li>
        <li>Paneer, as required, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>Processed cheese, grated as required</li>
        <li>Oregano seasoning, as required</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350F.</li>
        <li>Get your pizza base on a flat surface and spread the sauce on it using the back of a spoon or a spatula.</li>
        <li>Spread grated cheese on the pizza and be sure to cover the entire surface</li>
        <li>We can now start placing the toppings! Remember it is upto you, what and how much to place as your topping. Begin by placing the onion strips first</li>
        <li>Next, we place the bell peppers. You can arrange them randomly or however you want.</li>
        <li>Now, we sprinkle in the sweet corn kernels.</li>
        <li>The paneer goes as the last topping.</li>
        <li>You can take a cast iron skillet or a pizza stone. Either of them will work just fine. Be sure to coat the base of your skillet with oil first if you choose to use it. Place you pizza on it.</li>
        <li>Take your pizza stone/skillet and place it in the oven at 350F for 10-15 minutes. </li>
        <li>In the last 5 minutes of cooking, turn on your broiler to get some beautiful color on the surface. Keep a close eye though, things can burn quickly here</li>
        <li>Get your pizza out of the oven, remove it and place on a chopping board. Season with Oregano, and cut into 6 slices! Your hassle-free pizza is ready!</li>
