    <h4>Steps</h4>
    For the Khichdi
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the rice and dal together and wash them till the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Add the washed rice and dal along with the remaining ingredients to a pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Cook on high flame till 4-5 whistles.</li>
        <li>After the Khichdi has cooked, let it sit for a few minutes to let steam escape.</li>
        <li>Then, safely open the presuure cooker and remove the bay leaf and cinnamon stick. Your Khichdi is ready!</li>
    </ol>

    For the tadka
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, begin by adding oil and heat it up.</li>
        <li>Once the oil has heated, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>Add the chillies and curry leaves. Be careful of the oil splattering!</li>
        <li>After the splattering has reduced, add asofoetida and ginger garlic paste and let this cook for a minute ir two. 
            Be sure to stir things around to avoid burning.
        </li>
        <li>Add the onions and saute them until they get translucent or slightly pink in color.</li>
        <li>Once the onions have cooked, add turmeric and garam masala.
            Let these spices cook for some time.
        </li>
        <li>We can stir in the tomatoes and green peas next, and then season with salt. We cook until the tomatoes have become mushy and turn off our flame.</li>
    </ol>

    Now we combine the two!
    <ol>
        <li>In your Khichdi, stir in two cups of hot water.</li>
        <li>Whilst your tadka is still hot, we slowly add it to our now watered down Khichdi.</li>
        <li>Heat them up together, you can choose to add more water if required.</li>
        <li>After this cooked, we chop up some coriander and stir it in. </li>
        <li>To serve, pour your Dal Khichdi in a bowl, garnish with coriander. Serve with roasted papad. Your steaming bowl of comfort is ready!</li>
